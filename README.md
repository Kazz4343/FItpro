# FitPro

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

This is a front end project call FitPro. I build this using Next.js and as a part of my learning toward my goal as web developer. This is my first project that I build with Next.js. In this project, I didn't make any route yet because I want to feel familiar with typescript and how Next work first before I jump to advance tools and features.
